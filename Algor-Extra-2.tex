\begin{frame}[fragile]{Home Work 4: Problem 5: Thickness}
     Let $G$ be a simple undirected graph with n vertices labeled $1,2,. . .,n$. The graph $G[r_1 , r_2 , . . . , r_n ]$ is the graph obtained from G by replacing vertex $i$ with $K_{r_i}$ and connecting all possible vertices in neighboring complete graphs. So, for example, $G[1, 1, . . . , 1] = G$, $K_2 [2, 2] = K_4$ , $K_2 [m, n] = K_{m+n}$ , and $K_1 [n] = K_n$.
   
  Using R and igraph:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
g <- make_empty_graph(directed=F ) +
  vertices(1:3) +
  edge( c(1:3,1:3))
  plot(g)
\end{Sinput}

\begin{frame}{Part a }
    \begin{problem}
    The independence number $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the size of the largest set of independent (mutually nonadjacent) vertices in G. Prove that $\chi(G) \ge \frac{|V (G)|}{\alpha(G)}$.
     \end{problem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $a_1$ be the largest set of independent (mutually nonadjacent) vertices in G.

        Then there is a set $!a_1$ the members of which are by definition not in $a_1$ but are agent to a member of $a_1$.

        The set $!a_1$ can be sub divided in to set of independent vertices none of wich can be lager than $a_1$ or smaller than 1.

        It fallows that the maximum number of subsets is then $\frac{|V (G)|}{\alpha(G)}$.

        Note that for a correct coloring all members of an independent set can share one color(they are not adjacent), no two sets can share a color however (their nodes are adjacent).

        Thus the chromatic number must be greater or equal the number of independent sub sets.

        Therefore $\chi(G) \ge \frac{|V (G)|}{\alpha(G)}$.
    \end{proof}
